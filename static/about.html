        <h1>seq2seq date parser</h1>
        <p>
            The date parser uses a neural network type called a sequence to sequence model, or seq2seq for short.
            A seq2seq model consists of two recurrent neural networks. The first one encodes the input into a
            fixed size vector. The second one decodes that vector into the output. For more information see Andrej
            Karpathy great <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">blog post</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The model is trained on a generated data set using the <a href="http://babel.pocoo.org/">babel</a> package.
            I generate a random date between 1900 and 2100, and draw a random format and print the date in ISO-8601 and the drawn format. The model
            is then trained to produce the ISO-8601 date from the formatted one. Since the model has never seen dates outside the range 1900 - 2100 it has a
            hard time recognizing them.
        </p>

        <p>
            The code for reproducing the model (and this webpage) is available <a href="https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/normalization">here</a>. The model can probably be improved by using attention and coverage.
